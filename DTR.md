Project 3: Futbol  
Group Member Names: Jahara, Gunnar, Ryan, Joe, Kseniya

* Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):  
  - Joe: Learn CSV, improve on GitHub workflow practices, anything I can!!
  - KK: I would like to learn CSV, GitHub workflow with multiple contributors, and how to work with the same pace
- Ryan: Bare minimum: we have everything working and organized to Iteration 3. Good working knowledge of what it takes to conquer Iteration 4
 - Jahara: I’m definitely looking to better utilize CSV. I’ve got extensive experience in CSS and HTML, so hopefully that will come in handy when we tackle Iteration 4, but I know that’s going to require ERB.
- Gunnar: The last project I  worked with branching A LOT so hopefully can refine those skills when not working directly with someone. But same with everyone else I am not super familiar with CSV so hope to improve on that.

* Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
  -   Joe: Flexible, good at collaboration, very logic based thinking.
-Ryan: Objective analytical, Ace achiever, Self-Confident, Lover of Justice
  - KK: strengths - organizational skills, collaboration styles - divide and conquer. I need some time by myself to digest and make sense of information
- Gunnar: Always willing to communicate and open to talk. Turing is my life right now so I am always looking at Turing and slack(wide open schedule). Very thick skin and can take constructive criticism very well. People person.
- Jahara: I’m organized to a fault - I like having expectations laid out clearly. I believe it’s important to establish norms around how things are going to be handled re: Github pull requests, active collaboration time, division of labor, slack, etc.

* How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:  
Jahara: If we’re responsible, respectful and communicate appropriately, I think we should be just fine.
Ryan: Have the courage to check in on each other on a daily basis and give feedback on different categories of workflow.
KK: Communication is the key
Gunnar: ^ Communication is HUGE make sure to utilize slack channel ALL the time to keep the team updated 24/7.
* Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
  - Joe: I’m pretty open to work whenever it works best. I’m available till 11 pm MST but prefer to be off the computer around 8 as long as the project is up to speed.
- Ryan: I take a full hour for lunch when possible. I’m generally away from the computer from 10pm MT to 6am MT
  - KK: I prefer to work in the evenings and available most days after classes until 11 pm MST. However, in a group setting, i’m able to work up to 3.5 hours per day
- Jahara: I like scheduling project work time / check in time / project benchmarks at the beginning and then holding to those for the duration of the project. I am not spontaneous and have relatively limited time. I’ll complete whatever I commit to doing, but I’m not perpetually available
Gunnar:I am open all day as well as said earlier Turing is my life so all my time is dedicated to this.

* Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
  - Joe: Slack/GitHub. Daily communication unless everyone is up to date with what they need to do or when we need to meet up.
- Ryan: Daily communication is important and making an effort to zoom out to keep the big picture in mind.
 - Jahara: I’m around during Turing’s regular business hours. I also check slack -/+ 30min around times we’ve scheduled to be together, are going to check in, or have a deliverable due. Other than that, I don’t check Slack at all.
  - KK: Daily communication even if it’s to give heads up about availability
- Gunnar : Daily communication, keep the team up to date. Use slack channel to communicate along voicing any concerns.
* Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  - Joe: Becoming more fluent in the basics of ruby. Growing more with taking everything we’ve learned and building a thing with it.
- Ryan: I really like to build my organizational skills. I find that during reflection from past two projects. Getting things to work is generally easier than being well organized.
  - KK: I understand the basics of coding we cover in classes, however, unable to quickly solve the problem. Putting it on paper helps!
 - Jahara: Current abilities: CSS / HTML - I used CSV on our War or Peace project. I want to really dig into ERB, and I want our website to not just handle data, but also look visually appealing. I’ve seen this project by other groups in the past and think the visual area tends to be overlooked.
- Gunnar: Really putting to the test all the practice and lessons. Build off some of the areas I struggled in for my paired project. TDD is my biggest change needed for growth.

* Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
  - KK: I would like to understand how every aspect of the project works, however, we can divide and conquer certain parts, if applicable.
  - Joe: Even work distribution while still allowing the completed project to be a collaboration of our ideas.
- Ryan: I really enjoyed driver navigator with my partner on the last project. And, I enjoyed acknowledging that sometimes we slow each other down when attempting a complex problem together. Knowing when that is, is important.
- Jahara: I personally think we should divide into mini-groups in an attempt to not have too many people working on a single thing at a time. Those mini groups can then complete whatever iteration they are assigned and then come back to the group and present what they learned. I think if everyone has a hand in everything, it’s quickly going to become a mess. Also, I don’t think we should write any code until Wednesday; if Mike said that we’re going to have a lesson that’s going to require us to start over and change everything, why would we just not start after that lesson and save time, headache and frustration. These two days can then be spent learning about the areas we need to develop.

- Gunnar: since we are working in a team of 5 I think we should break off into groups of 3 or 2 and start working on different parts of the project to utilize time better. Don’t want several different opinions on 1 setting.

* Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

-Joe: Multiple reviews on merge. Debugging with pairs or as a group.
- KK: I suggest we limit main merge to at least 2 reviewers. For debugging - look at the code together (2+ people)
 - Ryan: Work buddies? Making sure someone who didn’t work on the code is merging
Jahara: I think there should be two people who approve any change that is merged to main. They need to actively comment BEFORE the merge.
-Gunnar: Yeahh I think if we do break into groups each others groups check the others for PR’s  

*Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
 -Ryan: Honesty. Just give it to me. In my last project we separated feedback into categories: Breaks, working focus, problem solving, brainstorming, Mickey mousing!
  -  KK: communication plus addressing issues as they come up
- Joe: Be kind and tactful.
Jahara: Be proactive if there is a challenge, but make sure to be kind.
-Gunnar: make sure to tackle the problem head on but make sure to not attack a person and be respectful and genuine when asking about others work.
* Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
  - Ryan: Pomodoro method, I would like a good way to share pseudo sessions
  - KK: GitHub and Slack channel
  - Joe: GitHub, Slack, maybe Trello?
 - Jahara: Trello.
- Gunnar: GitHub and Slack channel
